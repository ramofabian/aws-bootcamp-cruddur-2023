# Week 1 â€” App Containerization
## Required Homework/Tasks
### Watched Grading Homework Summaries
:white_check_mark: DONE.
### Watched Week 1 - Live Streamed Video
:white_check_mark: DONE.
### Remember to Commit Your Code
:white_check_mark: DONE.
### Watcked Chirag's Week 1 - Spending Considerations
:white_check_mark: DONE.
### Watched Ashish's Week 1 - Container Security Considerations
:white_check_mark: DONE.

I installed snyk and docker compose on my prsonal ubuntu VM and ran the docker-compose.yml as it was done from the video. Then I scanned the running docker containers to see if there is any security breaches. It was good exersice and very much stright forward procedure, I liked it becuse this is something that I had never done before.

I followed this procedure form this [link](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/install-the-snyk-cli)
```
# To download the packet
curl https://static.snyk.io/cli/latest/snyk-linux
chmod +x ./snyk
mv ./snyk /usr/local/bin/

# Check the version
snyk --version

# Login on Snyk system 
snyk auth

# Go to your to your docker directory where docker composer is placed
cd <<your docker directory>>

# Monitor de version immages
snyk monitor

# Scan your running container
snyk test 
```

Find below the evidence of the scan perfomed snyk CLI:

### Containerize Application (Dockerfiles, Docker Compose)
:white_check_mark: DONE. I didn't have any issues with running and bulding the dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml file becuasu I have some expirieance already with docker. Please find below my evidences of the work done:

#### Backend dockerfile
The file called "Dockerfile" inside of folder "backend-flask" was executed and the image was build with rm option which force the automatic container removal as soonas it is stopped:

<p align="center"><img src="assets/week1/backend_build_image.png" alt="accessibility text"></p>

Required local enviroments are were loaded and the previous created image called "backend-flask" is used to build the container attached, so the container output is prompted by the system.

<p align="center"><img src="assets/week1/Testing_backend_dockerfile.png" alt="accessibility text"></p>

As a requisit, the port must be in public state on gitpod VSCode platform:

<p align="center"><img src="assets/week1/Testing_backend_dockerfile_public_ports.png" alt="accessibility text"></p>

As a result, we can enter the URL and by adding the path `/api/activities/home` at the end, we will be able to see the backend response in a json fromat as shos the picture below:

<p align="center"><img src="assets/week1/backend_we_answer.png" width="400" alt="accessibility text"></p>

Then we stop the container and run it in deatch mode, so we can check it's status and logs as it is stated below:

<p align="center"><img src="assets/week1/docker_deatached_backend.png" alt="accessibility text"></p>

#### Frontend dockerfile
The React framework is installed with command `npm i` and the file called "Dockerfile" inside of folder "frontend-react-js" was executed and the image was build:
<table>
  <tr>
<td><p align="center"><img src="assets/week1/frontend_installation.png" alt="accessibility text"></p></td>
<td><p align="center"><img src="assets/week1/docker_build_frontend.png" alt="accessibility text"></p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Then the container is deployed in deatach mode and the logs are checked without seeing any problem:

<td><p align="center"><img src="assets/week1/deploying_frontend_container.png" alt="accessibility text"></p></td>

We make sure the port is running in publick mode:

<td><p align="center"><img src="assets/week1/open_port_frontend_gitpod.png" alt="accessibility text"></p></td>

And we can see hat we can open the URL in a new explorer tab:

<td><p align="center"><img src="assets/week1/frontend_web_access.png" alt="accessibility text"></p></td>

Finally we stop an remove the container:

<td><p align="center"><img src="assets/week1/docker_frontend_removal.png" alt="accessibility text"></p></td>

#### Docker compose
A new file called docker-compose.yml needs to be created at `/workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023` path with the following information:

<p align="center"><img src="assets/week1/Docker_compose_directory.png" alt="accessibility text"></p>

```
version: "3.8"
services:
  backend-flask:
    environment:
      FRONTEND_URL: "https://3000-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}"
      BACKEND_URL: "https://4567-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}"
    build: ./backend-flask
    ports:
      - "4567:4567"
    volumes:
      - ./backend-flask:/backend-flask
  frontend-react-js:
    environment:
      REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL: "https://4567-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}"
    build: ./frontend-react-js
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./frontend-react-js:/frontend-react-js

# the name flag is a hack to change the default prepend folder
# name when outputting the image names
networks: 
  internal-network:
    driver: bridge
    name: cruddur
```

With the command `docker-compose up -d ` the backend and frontend images are build based on previous dockerfiles, then they are used to deploy the containers connected with an internal network called cruddur.

The containers status and images can be seen working fine as it is displayed on the picture below:
